# NetSuite Setup of Thumbnail folder

To successfully upload thumbnails to NetSuite, you need the following 3 things:
* OAuth `clientId` and `clientSecret` (aka consumer key and consumer secret)
* A `scriptId`
* A `folderId`
* A variable to assign the fileId to


Steps involved in setting up NetSuite:
* [Setup OAuth](#setup-oauth) - gives you permissions to upload files +  `clientId` and `clientSecret`
* [Setup restlet for uploading thumbnails (SuiteApi)](#setup-restlet-for-uploading-thumbnails-suiteapi) - gives you the `scriptId`
* [Setup an upload folder](#setup-an-upload-folder) - gives you the `folderId`
* [Putting it all together](#putting-it-all-together---setup-the-datasource) - configuring the datasource in SharpSync

<hr />

## Setup OAuth

**Goal**: To get the the necessary permissions to upload files


Steps required:

* Setup OAuth (this step)
* Install SuiteApi
* Create a new thumbnails folder in NetSuite
* Setup the datasource to point to the new restlet

See [NetSuite OAuth Setup](netsuite_oauth.md)

<hr />

## Setup restlet for uploading thumbnails (SuiteApi)

Steps required:

* (done) Setup OAuth
* Install SuiteApi (this step)
* Create a new thumbnails folder in NetSuite
* Setup the datasource to point to the new restlet

See [Setup restlet for uploading thumbnails (SuiteApi)](suite-api.md)
Original source [Suite API Setup](suite_api_setup.md)

<hr />

## Setup an upload folder

**Goal**: To get a folder id

Steps required:

* (done) Setup OAuth 
* (done) Install SuiteApi
* Create a new thumbnails folder in NetSuite (this step)
* Setup the datasource to point to the new restlet
 
 See [Setup an upload folder](netsuite_setup_thumbnail_folder.md)


## Putting it all together - Setup the datasource

**Goal**: To configure the datasource in SharpSync


Steps required:

* (done) Setup OAuth 
* (done) Install SuiteApi
* (done) Create a new thumbnails folder in NetSuite 
* Setup the datasource to point to the new restlet (this step)
 

With the copied URL in the previous step, and the `folderId` and `scriptId` in hand, it's time to setup the datasource in SharpSync. 

In SharpSync add a new data source > NetSuite.

### Configuring NetSuite

There are 2 configuration sections for each datasource
* Authentication
* BOM Configuration

#### Authentication

* Navigate to the Datasources > Config UI
* Select the NetSuite datasource > Add
* Set the server url > Click 'Update'
* Click the Ping button to test the connection. This is optional and will not work if ICMP is disabled on the server
* Click the 'Configure' button
* Enter the following values:
