# Property Mapping
Property Mapping defines the way BOM data is displayed in SharpSync. Property Mappings can display a variety of CAD information including (but not limited to) BOM columns, Part or Assembly properties, Configurations, or CAD model data. SharpSync has built-in rules and settings for each property mapping. These rules and settings are used to help codify, standardize, and push changes to the selected datasources.

### Adding Property Mappings
1. On the Property Mapping page, select the Property you wish to map to the BOM.	
    * The column headers you entered in the Datasource BOM Configuration will populate each Property Mapping.
	* Each Property Mapping will be displayed as a column on the Component Assembly BOM page.

2. Once you have selected the property mappings that you want to appear in the SharpSync BOM, confirm that the Accessors, Primary Datasource Accessors, and Secondary Datasource Accessors columns are correct. You can double click on the cells in each column to change the value SharpSync will be matching. The accessor must be present in the appropriate datasource.
